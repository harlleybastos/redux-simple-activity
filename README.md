## 📜 About

This a **SIMPLE PROJECT** that was developed with the intuition of learn **Redux**, one of greatest features of ReactJS.

In it you will find a small banking system with two actions, deposit and withdrawal. Only that !

And believe me, I was able to understand the concepts of everything that happens much better.
